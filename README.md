# Network Intruder Detector
This repository contains source code and documentation for the practical work of [APA](http://www.fib.upc.edu/fib/estudiar-enginyeria-informatica/assignatures/APA) subject (FIB, UPC, Barcelona, Catalunya). It tries to solve the problem first proposed by the KDD-cup from 1999 ([KDD-cup99](http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html)). Its objective is to train a classifier in order to detect when TCP traffic is due to a network intrusion, and classify this intrusion.

The structure of the project is as follows:
* **Code** A folder in which you can find all the scripts, written in *R* that we used.
* **Doc** The *LaTex* related files used in documentation
